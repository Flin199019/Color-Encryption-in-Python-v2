# Color-Encryption-in-Python-v2
This is basic explanations of what I'm looking for and how this code functions.  It needs attention. 

ME and Ai Conversation... 

Read Up!!! This kinda sums it up,  but It needs more expertise!!! 

I want python code that will allow me to choose one of four colors, with a small graphical user interface,  that lets me select any of the following colors for example,  white,  red,  yellow and blue, so for each character, number or special character that I select I could choose a color  before I continue with the rest of the password or pass phrase.  Everything I enter a character  it must prompt me for a color.  That color scheme for the password should match the exact color scheme for the password before authenticating and accepting the password. I want to create this color code encryption so that key loggers won't work on this type of color encrypted passwords.  I want to create this program to act as a secondary verification for logging into your operating system,  also for secondary school security  and for use of administration passwords and root passwords.  I want this program to work fluently on Windows,  Linux and Mac Operating Systems. When the action is taken to select a color after each character I want it to be undetectable by key logger programs and other malicious software ,  it should have a strict and random kind of encryption for the color keys being selected so that it won't be possible for key logger and other programs to record the colors as information  which you have selected for the password.  I also want to integrate a safety feature option such as after 3 failed attempts to select the correct characters and correct matching colors for the password, should make the system to be totally locked and that the new recovery characters and color scheme should be immediately emailed to the administrators email  address,  and only when the administrator verified the notice of system lock, then only the system will allow the recovery colors and characters combination to be entered again. A Internet connection is required for that function to work and will only use the network to verify  the acknowledgement of system lock notice received. Also the program should keep accessable logs with read only permissions of which verification method was used,  when and from who,  such as log in screen access, remote desktop or ssh protocols with user details and iP address if applicable.  I also need this program to be bug free,  it should work effectively with out any complications.  I want this program also to work on both 32 bit and 64 bit Operating System Architectures like on Windows,  Linux and Mac Operating system other known as OSX. I want this program to have a graphical user interface that you can select the color after each character is entered and be able to choose/ select the color with keyboard arrows with enter or return button or otherwise with a optical mouse by clicking on a selected color option.  Can you give me the complete code for this program from start to finish,  with a complete repository that contains different code and files and functions and that there is also code to make the program  be synchronized with all files and scripts  and code.  You can break it down to different files as long as the program is completed with all files.  I also need there to be a installation wizard for the installation of this program.  It should be compatible with 32 bit and 64 bit Windows,  Linux and Mac OS Systems.




Creating a comprehensive program with all the specified features, including encryption, color selection, anti-keylogger measures, and recovery options, requires extensive coding and a detailed design. It's beyond the scope of a single response in this format. However, I can guide you on how you might structure the project. You can then build upon this foundation, or seek professional development assistance for a more robust and secure implementation.Let's break down the structure of your program:Encryption Module (encryption.py):Implement an encryption method for color codes.Ensure that the encryption logic is robust and difficult to reverse engineer.Color Selection Module (color_selection.py):Create a GUI for color selection after each character input.Allow users to select colors using keyboard arrows or a mouse.Anti-Keylogger Measures (anti_keylogger.py):Implement a mechanism to make the color selection undetectable by keyloggers.Explore techniques like on-screen keyboards or other methods that bypass traditional keyloggers.Security Module (security.py):Implement the three-strike lockout feature and recovery email notification.Include logging functionality for authentication attempts.Main Program (main.py):Integrate the above modules into a cohesive program.Implement an installation wizard using appropriate libraries for each operating system.Cross-Platform Compatibility:Ensure compatibility with both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, Linux, and macOS.Use libraries like Tkinter for GUI, cryptography for encryption, and platform-specific libraries for system-related tasks.Repository Structure:Organize the code into folders (e.g., src, data, logs).Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the program.Installation Wizard (install.py):Create a script to guide users through the installation process.Adjust installation steps based on the user's operating system.Remember, a robust security system involves constant testing and updates. It's highly recommended to consult with a cybersecurity professional to ensure the program's effectiveness against potential vulnerabilities. Building such a system requires expertise in security and software development, and a collaborative approach with security experts is advised.


Certainly! I'll provide you with simplified examples for each module to help you get started. Keep in mind that these examples are basic and may need enhancement based on your specific requirements.Encryption Module (encryption.py):from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt_text(text, key):
    cipher = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_text = cipher.encrypt(text.encode())
    return encrypted_text

def decrypt_text(encrypted_text, key):
    cipher = Fernet(key)
    decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_text).decode()
    return decrypted_text

# Example key generation (you should handle key storage securely)
key = Fernet.generate_key()Color Selection Module (color_selection.py):from tkinter import Tk, Button, simpledialog

def select_color():
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry("200x150")

    color_options = ['white', 'red', 'yellow', 'blue']

    def on_color_click(color):
        root.destroy()
        return color

    buttons = [Button(root, text=color, command=lambda c=color: on_color_click(c)) for color in color_options]
    for button in buttons:
        button.pack()

    root.mainloop()

# Example usage:
selected_color = select_color()
print(f"Selected Color: {selected_color}")Anti-Keylogger Measures (anti_keylogger.py):Consider using on-screen keyboards or other creative methods to input characters.Security Module (security.py):import logging

def log_authentication(attempt_details):
    logging.basicConfig(filename='auth_logs.log', level=logging.INFO)
    logging.info(attempt_details)

def lockout_notification(email, user):
    # Implement email notification logic here
    pass

def lockout_check(attempts):
    max_attempts = 3
    if attempts >= max_attempts:
        user_email = "admin@example.com"  # Replace with your admin email
        lockout_notification(user_email, "admin")

# Example usage:
log_authentication("Successful login attempt from user X")
lockout_check(2)  # Example: 2 failed attemptsMain Program (main.py):This file will integrate the above modules and handle the main program logic.Cross-Platform Compatibility:Use platform-specific libraries for tasks such as filesystem access and subprocess execution.Repository Structure:Organize your project into folders such as src, data, logs, and include a README file.Installation Wizard (install.py):Use a library like PyInstaller for Python to create platform-specific executables.Provide user prompts to guide them through the installation process.Please note that these examples are simplified and you should thoroughly test and enhance each module according to your specific security requirements. Always consider best practices for securely handling keys, user data, and email notifications.
